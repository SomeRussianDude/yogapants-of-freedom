  storyText: "You're Sara, a 42-year-old yoga teacher/entrepreneur. While having
    a walk in the park with your family you're presented with a strange little device
    by your son. He found it in the bushes. \"What do you have there, honey?\" \r\n\r\nYou
    touch the device and out of a sudden ground drops from underneath your feet.
    In complete darkness an unforgivingly cold wind starts whirling around you. You're
    clearly flying somewhere else at an enormous speed.\r\n\r\nYou don't have much
    choice here, all you can do is react. So will you or will you not scream?\r\n\r\n1.
    Scream\r\n\r2. Remain Silent"
