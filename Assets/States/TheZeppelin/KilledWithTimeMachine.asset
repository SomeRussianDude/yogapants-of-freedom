  storyText: 'You had no idea you were capable of such a thing: with a single strike
    on the head you kill the ugly creature. Finally you can look around: how strange,
    the walls of the room seem to also be made of steel.. You notice that the floor
    is vibrating slightly and there''s a constant humming sound coming from behind
    one of the walls.

    

    The cage is closed with a simple bolt, meant for
    locking animals, not humans. You step out, immediately grab a knife hanging on
    the wall by the door and try the door handle: looks like it''s unlocked.

    

    1.
    Go out of the room'
