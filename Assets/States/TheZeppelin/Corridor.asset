  storyText: "You're in a narrow corridor, like one of those you can find on a train.
    At least the mystery of the steel walls is solved now: you look out of the window
    and see clouds and a humongous baloon above. You're on a huge zeppelin.\r\n\r\nThere
    are indications on the wall but they're not of much help, if only you had been
    more attentive at the German class at school: the arrow pointing to the right
    says \"Gef\xE4ngnis\", to the left there should be a \"Labor\".. So what shall
    it be?\r\n\r\n1. Gef\xE4ngnis\r\n\r2. Labor"
