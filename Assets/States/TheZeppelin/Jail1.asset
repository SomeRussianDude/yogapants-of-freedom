  storyText: "The corridor makes a turn and you find a strong iron door with \"Gef\xE4ngnis\"
    written on it. It is slightly open. But as you enter the room it silently locks
    behind you.\r\n\r\nSomething about this ship and cages: the room is clearly a
    jail. There's a prisoner sitting on the floor in a cage similar to one you just
    escaped from.  In front of it there's a guard sleeping on a chair. Three things
    catch your eye and make you shiver: the prisoner is missing a leg, the guard
    is wearing an SS uniform and the calendar above the desk says October 1969.\r\n\r\nWhatever
    the hell is going on here you see few options before you:\r\n\r\n1. Kill the
    guard in his sleep\r\n\r2. Wake him up putting the knife to his neck\r\r\n3.
    Try to sneak out through the door on the opposite side of the room"
