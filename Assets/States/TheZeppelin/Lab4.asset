  storyText: "The scientist wasn't expecting that. Startled, he raises his gun, takes
    a step forward, steps into the puddle of oil, slips - and in the fall knocks
    himself out cold hitting the desk with his head.\r\n\r\nYou grab the gun and
    look around: you need to act fast before he comes to. You notice a door that
    says \"Cockpit\" on it. So what are you going to do?\r\n\r\n1. Run to the Cockpit\r\n\r2.
    Tie the Russian down\r\n\r3. Try to use the machine and go home"
