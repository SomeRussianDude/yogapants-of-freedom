  storyText: "The journey stops as abruptly as it had started. You're laying in the
    corner of a large steel cage in a spacious room with a very low ceiling. Something
    is pulling your arm down: the device that brought you here is still in your hand.
    You're not alone in the cage, in the other corner you see a horrible creature:
    a body of a rottweiler is carrying a wild boar's head, and it's tail is something
    you would normally see on a reptile.\r\n\r\nYour screams have drawn it's attention,
    the beast has dropped its meal - a human leg - and is rushing in your direction.
    What are you going to do now?\r\n\r\n1. Try to tame the beast\r\n\r2. Attack
    it with the device"
