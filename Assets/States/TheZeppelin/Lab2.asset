  storyText: 'The scientist is content, he lowers the gun. Anticipating your questions
    he begins: "The previous ones appeared outside of the vessel, fell to death,
    didn''t even let us run some tests, do the trepanation.. You obviously appeared
    somewhere in the next cabins, I can only wonder where you got your weapon from.
    You were supposed to land INSIDE the machine! And instead you toasted it!" -
    He''s pointing at the smoking device. He''s very angry and clearly blaming you
    for breaking his toy.

    

    You''ve had enough of this nonsense.
