  storyText: "The journey stops as abruptly as it had started. You're laying in the
    corner of a large steel cage in a spacious room with a very low ceiling. Something
    is pulling your arm down: the device that brought you here is still in your hand.
    You're not alone in the cage, in the other corner you see a horrible creature:
    a body of a rottweiler is carrying a wild boar's head, and it's tail is something
    you would normally see on a reptile.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the beast hasn't noticed
    your emergence. It's peacefully chewing on its meal - a human leg. What's your
    next move?\r\n\r\n1. Sneak up and attack it with the device\r\r\n2. Try to tame
    the beast"
