  storyText: 'Not the most noble thing you''ve done in your life but what else are
    you supposed to do to armed nazi prison guards.


    The one-legged man introduces
    himself as Thomas, he has a strong Australian accent. He''s very greatful - the
    guard had fallen asleep as he got tired of torturing him. But you''re actually
    unable to set poor Tommy free: the cage can only be opened from the cockpit.
    "Your help won''t go unrewarded: the Rebel Alliance of Oceania will pay you handsomely
    in potable water!"


    You take the guard''s pistol and fighting the desire
    for a thousand questions head towards the door.


    1. Go through the door'
